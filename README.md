## v5 is discontinued

**Why ? Running out of time?**

No, unlike most abandoned projects, this is not the problem. We decided that Atlanta should be a bot that should be easy to host yourself and modify and v5 didn't allow that. The performance was better (use of Lavalink for music, better architecture, more commands) but the code was too complex for Atlanta to continue to be an easy to install open source bot. So we decided to leave this branch aside for now (maybe come back one day with another bot?) but it will never be merged.

**ALl right, and does this branch work?**

This branch can work, if you have a good knowledge you should be able to leave it without any harm, but there is no documentation and we won't provide any help for the installation. No pull request to this branch will be accepted.
